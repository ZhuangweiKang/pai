# We relay on iftop & lsof to implement network consumption statistic. We first get all
# network consuption by iftop, this command can run in any namespace, it will output
# connetion & connection's consumption in some duration(40s), this consumption is node wide
# statistic. We break this statistic down into container level by running lsof, lsof must
# run in container's PID namespace. This will collect all connection pairs in that namespace.
# If the container is running in host namespace, then, lsof will output connection pairs in
# node level instead of container level.
# So current implementation is not workable for container running in host PID namespace.
# Also since lsof can not capture most of short-lived connections, this workaround is useful
# for long-lived connections.

# To bring lsof in container's PID namespace, job exporter needs to be in host PID namespace
# and is privileged. This has serious security issue since any people can exec into
# job-exporter container and have root access to system wide resources, we prevent this by
# enabling DenyEscalatingExec in kubernets,
# see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#denyescalatingexec
